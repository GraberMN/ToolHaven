# Tool Haven
Welcome to Tool Haven, an awesome website that provides 6 free easy-to-use tools for your convenience and to increase your productivity. These tools include a Calculator, Rulers [in., cm, picas, px], Timers [countdown and stopwatch], an AI Chatbot, an Img Identifier, and a Paintbrush application. Have fun, and I hope you enjoy my helpful website!

Note: I learned how to use commit names to show what improvements each commit made halfway through this project.
